# TwitterQuoteScraper

_One day I was thinking about creating a web application that displays quotations randomly. There are already lots of this on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/search/pens?q=random%20quote%20generator&page=1&order=popularity&depth=everything), but I want to experience on how to develop both of its frontend and backend functionalities. I need the data first, and I assume Twitter can help me with this!_
