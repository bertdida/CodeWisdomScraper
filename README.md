## Usage

To get started, enable the virtual environment by running:

```shell
pipenv shell
```

All commands should start by providing the `--twitter-creds` argument. Its value should be the path to JSON file that holds your Twitter app's credentials, see `creds/twitter.json` for the expected keys.
